Exercise 10.3

Write a program that reads a file and prints the letters in decreasing
order of frequency. Your program should convert all the input to lower case and
only count the letters a-z. Your program should not count spaces, digits, punctuation
or anything other than the letters a-z. Find text samples from several different
languages and see how letter frequency varies between languages. Compare your
results with the tables at wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequencies.
